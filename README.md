# DeveloperExtras

## Introduction
**Developer Extras** is a Cyberpunk 2077 Mod that is based on [Cyber Engine Tweaks](https://github.com/yamashi/CyberEngineTweaks) and written in [Lua](https://www.lua.org/). It allows the user to switch internal developer toggles and save/export these settings. It comes with a clean and fancy UI and allows directly to change graphic related settings from game itself. Like a Swiss Knife for all performance related settings.

## Installation
For the GitHub Release, drop the files into:  
    **"\<INSTALL DIR\>\bin\x64\plugins\cyber_engine_tweaks\mods\DeveloperExtras"**

## Notes
This Repository is for development only and not for Mod Users who can't wait, so don't report crashes or bugs on unreleased software. :P

It is planned to release this mod on [NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/cyberpunk2077), when it is ready.
